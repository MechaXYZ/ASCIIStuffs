1
00:00:03,907 --> 00:00:05,149
Just as I thought...

2
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:08,200
Joseph's blood worked...

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,250
It worked perfectly!

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,000
I can feel my power growing like never before!

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,750
It worked...

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,500
It really worked!

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,250
Although this body once belonged to
Jonathan Joestar a mere one hundred years ago...

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,750
...it is now imbued with the blood of his grandson, Joseph...

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:39,750
and the one who made this possible
by allowing me to escape, Jotaro, is you!

10
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:47,500
The Joestar bloodline was mere dog feces
lying in the road to my destiny!

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,250
In the end, you Joestars were nothing
more than tools for me to use as I pleased!

12
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,500
G-Gramps...

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,250
No matter what...

14
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:24,000
No matter what, even if Dio does something to my body...

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,500
...you can't let your rage get the better of you, Jotaro.

16
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,000
You don't need to concern yourself with me anymore.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,250
This happened because it had to.

18
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,000
Is this... Gramps'... soul?

19
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,250
Kakyoin solved the mystery of Dio's Stand.

20
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,250
And I relayed his final message to you.

21
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:52,250
Had we all fought Dio at once,
he would have wiped us out instantly.

22
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,500
I've seen that you can move a bit while time is stopped.

23
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,750
For about two or three seconds.

24
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,000
Use that time wisely.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,500
No matter what Dio does next, don't lose your cool.

26
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,500
If you attack him with blind rage,
you'll put yourself in a bad situation.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,750
Jotaro...

28
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,750
This was a pretty great trip, huh?

29
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,750
A lot has happened to us.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,500
I swear...

31
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,500
We've had such a fun fifty days...

32
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,750
Was that real?

33
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,000
Hey!

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,500
What are you gawking at, Jotaro?!

35
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,250
Y-You bastard!

36
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,250
Now he is an empty shell!

37
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,750
Gramps told me not to lose my cool...

38
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,750
...but I can't help it!

39
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,000
I can't stay calm after seeing what he just did!

40
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,000
This is the final round!

41
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:09,985
Episode 48: A Long Journey's End, and a Farewell to Friends
第48話 遥かなる旅路 さらば友よ

42
00:05:09,986 --> 00:05:13,029
The World! Time Stop!  

43
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,000
Wryyyy!

44
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,250
One second has passed! Two seconds have passed!

45
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,000
Three seconds have passed! Four seconds...

46
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,250
Wryyyy!
Ora!

47
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,250
Ora Ora Ora Ora!

48
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,500
Ora!

49
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,750
Five seconds have passed.

50
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,000
Six seconds have passed.

51
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,750
Seven seconds have passed!

52
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,750
I still feel the power surging within me!

53
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,000
I can stop time for even longer!

54
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,500
By the way, Jotaro...

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,750
You should no longer be able to move.

56
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,250
You likely assumed you would be able to move
two seconds before I resumed time, but...

57
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,000
...you have made a fatal error!

58
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,500
This is a truly magnificent feeling!

59
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,750
I feel as though I could begin singing!

60
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,000
Eight seconds have passed!

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,500
I first attained immortality one hundred years ago, but...

62
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:18,000
...it never felt nearly as good as the feeling I have right now!

63
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,250
The blood of a Joestar is just what I needed!

64
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,500
This is an amazing high!

65
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,750
G-Gramps... you were right...

66
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,000
Losing my cool got me into trouble...

67
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Still, this isn't freaking over!

68
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,750
I have some rage I need to let out!

69
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,500
Nine seconds have passed!

70
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Time has stopped for nine seconds!

71
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,250
However, nine seconds seems to be my current limit.

72
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,000
Y-You bastard...

73
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,500
Wryyyy!

74
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,750
Prepare to meet the full power of my Stand!

75
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,500
Jotaro! Earlier you mentioned being unable to keep calm...

76
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,750
...but your fury has clearly reached its limit!

77
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,000
Muda Muda Muda Muda!

78
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,500
Muda!

79
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,000
Prepare yourself for my final attack!

80
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is it! My final Time Stop!

81
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,750
Using the nine seconds during which I can move
while time is stopped, I will emerge victorious!

82
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,000
The World!

83
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,250
One second has passed.

84
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Two seconds have passed.

85
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,250
Three seconds have passed.

86
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,750
Dio, for reasons unknown, disappeared while time was stopped.

87
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,500
Four seconds have passed.

88
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Still, Jotaro had no time to think.

89
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:10,500
Dio was up to something, so while time was stopped, for the
two seconds Jotaro could move, no matter what attack he may face...

90
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,250
...for those two seconds, the only thing
he could do is retaliate with Star Platinum!

91
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,250
Five seconds have passed.

92
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:27,000
If there's one thing I know for sure, Dio,
it's that the instant you show your ugly face, I'll beat it to a pulp!

93
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,000
Six seconds have passed.

94
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,500
Bring it on, Dio!

95
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,750
Seven seconds have passed.

96
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,000
Road roller!

97
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Ora Ora Ora Ora!

98
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,250
Time is up! There is no escape!

99
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,250
Muda Muda Muda Muda!

100
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,250
Ora Ora Ora Ora!

101
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,250
Muda Muda Muda Muda!

102
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,750
Eight seconds have passed!

103
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,750
Wryyyy!

104
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,500
I shall smash you into the ground!

105
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,750
Ora!

106
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,250
Nine seconds have passed.

107
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,000
I've done it.

108
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,500
Victory is mine.

109
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,500
Star Platinum has finally been defeated by The World!

110
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,500
Immortality! Eternal life...

111
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,750
...and Stand power!

112
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,500
Here lies proof that none shall surpass the mighty Dio!

113
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,500
Pathetic humans! I will rule you all!

114
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,000
Bow before my knowledge and might!

115
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Ten seconds have passed!

116
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,750
My ability to stop time has reached ten seconds!

117
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,250
Now, then...

118
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,500
...I shall find Jotaro's lifeless body and drink his blood!

119
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,750
If he has any left, that is!

120
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
W-What?

121
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,250
My body... i-is slowing down...

122
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,000
N-No... it isn't slowing down...

123
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,250
I-I cannot move! I-Impossible!

124
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:38,000
M-My body is frozen in place...

125
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,250
Dio!

126
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,250
It's been eleven seconds.

127
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,500
I guess that's your limit.

128
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,000
What?!

129
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,750
I stopped time at the nine second mark.

130
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,500
That's how I escaped.

131
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,250
Gimme a break...

132
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
And now...

133
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,500
...I'll use my last second to defeat you for good!

134
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:09,000
J-Jotaro!

135
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,750
I-Impossible! You stopped time?

136
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:26,000
Somehow... you did it right as I reached my nine second limit...

137
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,500
How does it feel, Dio?

138
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,000
Having someone come at you from behind while you can't move a muscle...

139
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:43,250
In a way, it's like if you were holding your breath underwater,
and just as you came up for air...

140
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:50,000
...someone suddenly grabbed you,
dragging you right back down into the depths below.

141
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,500
Sound familiar?

142
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,750
But I can't say I feel sorry for you.

143
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,250
Ora!

144
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Time has begun to move again.

145
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,750
There's not even a shred of sympathy for you in my body.

146
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,500
Don't expect any pity from me.

147
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,750
Still, if I finished you off by beating you to death...

148
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,500
...it would leave a bad taste in my mouth.

149
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,000
How many seconds until your legs recover?

150
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,000
Three seconds? Four seconds?

151
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,250
I'll let Star Platinum loose on you the second you heal!

152
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,500
Bring it on!

153
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,750
If I were a gunman from a Western, I'd say...

154
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:52,000
"Draw. Let's see who's got the fastest gun in the West,"
or something like that.

155
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,500
He's mocking me!

156
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,250
But... But, Jotaro...

157
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,000
You may have made it this far,
but you are still just a mere human!

158
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,000
With such precious little time to live,
you think just as every other human does!

159
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,750
You worry about living a life free of regret,
and doing things that would leave a "bad taste" in your mouth...

160
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:26,500
But that kind of reasoning is as compelling as rat feces
left in a bathroom, and will only lead to your demise!

161
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,500
The mighty Dio has no such thoughts!

162
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,750
I have just one simple thought on my mind!

163
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,250
Only one!

164
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,000
To be victorious and reign supreme! Nothing else!

165
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That alone will satisfy me.

166
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,250
And just how I reach that end...

167
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,750
...matters not!

168
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,750
How does it feel to be blinded by my blood?!

169
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I win!

170
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,399
Die!

171
00:13:57,827 --> 00:14:00,264
Ora!

172
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:27,000
What?!

173
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,500
I-Impossible... I-I am Dio...

174
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,750
I am the mighty Dio!

175
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,000
You'll be dust once the sun comes up.

176
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,250
In the end, you lost for just one reason, Dio.

177
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,000
Just one simple reason.

178
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,500
You pissed me off.

179
00:15:07,482 --> 00:15:08,309
Dio... and the World...

180
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,882
Dio... and the World...
Suffering

181
00:15:08,883 --> 00:15:09,109
Dio... and the World...
Suffering Utter

182
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,109
Dio... and the World...
Suffering Utter Defeat...

183
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:10,355
Dio... and the World...
Suffering Utter Defeat... Have

184
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:12,355
Dio... and the World...
Suffering Utter Defeat... Have Died.

185
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,000
Speedwagon car #2 reporting.

186
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,250
We're heading north on el-Nil Street.

187
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,000
Dio's body has been retrieved.

188
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,750
I repeat, Dio's body has been retrieved.

189
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,500
Dio's body will live until it's exposed to sunlight.

190
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Proceed with caution!

191
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,250
Don't let your guard down.

192
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,000
Roger.

193
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,250
Kakyoin Noriaki is dead.
We're transporting his body by helicopter.

194
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,750
Jean Pierre Polnareff is unconscious.

195
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,750
He's being treated in car #1.

196
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,000
Roger.

197
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,500
By the way, I have a question for you.

198
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,500
Why did you put Dio and Joseph Joestar's bodies in the same car?

199
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,250
This isn't over.

200
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,250
Dio took something...

201
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,750
...and I'm gonna take it back.

202
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,750
What are you talking about?

203
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,750
Is it possible to transfuse blood from one corpse to another?

204
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,750
I-Impossible! Are you suggesting we transfuse
Dio's blood into Mr. Joestar's lifeless body?

205
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,250
Are you trying to bring Mr. Joestar back to life?

206
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,000
Dio sucked his blood out just a few minutes ago.

207
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,250
Even though Dio's upper body is destroyed.
The needs to return what he has left.

208
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,500
You think we have enough time?

209
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,000
There's your answer. Do you read? Over.

210
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,500
R-Roger...

211
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,000
It's impossible! He has no pulse!

212
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,250
His heart is stopped,
which means it's impossible for blood to pump through his body!

213
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,500
Impossible?

214
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,000
Our journey has been full of impossibilities.

215
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,500
I'm sick and tired of hearing that things are
"impossible" or "futile." It means nothing to us.

216
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,500
You said his heart has to be pumping, right?

217
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,000
How fortunate.

218
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,000
I've had some experience with
stopping and starting hearts thanks to Dio.

219
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,500
Ora!

220
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,750
There's a pulse!

221
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,500
His heart's moving!

222
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,750
Hurry! Extract the blood from
Dio's body and perform the transfusion!

223
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,750
This just might work!

224
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,000
L-Look!

225
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,250
His shriveled skin is already regaining color!

226
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
His flesh is softening and stretching!

227
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,750
Brainwaves! I'm detecting brainwaves!

228
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,750
I can't believe it! He has a regular heartbeat!

229
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,250
His eyes! He opened his eyes!

230
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,750
We did it! He's come back to life!

231
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,750
Gramps?

232
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Jotaro, you fool!

233
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,000
Y-You asshole! It can't be...

234
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,500
I live again thanks to you!

235
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,750
You!

236
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:48,000
W-Wait, Jotaro! I'm kidding! Kidding! I'm just kidding!

237
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,750
It's just a joke! A joke!

238
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,250
I'm sorry! I just wanted to mess with you a little.

239
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,500
It's definitely me!

240
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm Joseph Joestar. I was born September 27th, 1920.

241
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,500
My wife's name is Suzi Q! I like collecting comic books!

242
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,250
Which actress plays the female lead
in the 1981 film, Tarzan, the Ape Man?

243
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,750
Bo Derek.

244
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,750
Who sang the parody of "Beat It," called "Eat It"?

245
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,436
Al Yankovic.

246
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:22,500
Gimme a break.
Only someone like you would know pointless stuff like that.

247
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Car #2 reporting! It's a miracle!

248
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,750
Mr. Joestar has woken up!

249
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,000
Mr. Joestar came back from the dead!

250
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Hooray! Over!

251
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:41,000
Now you've returned what you took from us, Dio.

252
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,750
It's over now.

253
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,750
Too many people have given up something to Dio.

254
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,250
For the last one-hundred years,
there have been so many people...

255
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,000
...who have given things up to him.

256
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,500
Most of it will never be returned.

257
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,750
Yeah, he took so much. Way too much...

258
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,500
What we've lost to him
may be even greater than the earth itself.

259
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,000
Still, because of those we lost...

260
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,250
Because of them, we're alive right now.

261
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,000
Kakyoin...

262
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Iggy...

263
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,000
Avdol...

264
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,750
It's over.

265
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,750
Are you really going back to France, Polnareff?

266
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,000
You don't have any more family there, do you?

267
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,500
Why don't you come to New York with me?

268
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:26,500
Mr. Joestar, even though my family is gone,
France is still my homeland.

269
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I have good memories of my hometown.

270
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,250
I have to go back no matter where my travels take me.

271
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,500
But give me a call if you ever need me!

272
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,250
No matter where you are in the world, I'll come running!

273
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,000
It'll be lonely without you.

274
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,000
Even though we've gone through a lot...

275
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,250
...I still had a lot of fun!

276
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,000
It was a fun journey with you guys there!

277
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,750
Yeah, it really was fun.
believe that from the bottom of my heart.

278
00:22:01,055 --> 00:22:07,345
Passengers on France International Airlines Flight 92,
bound for Paris, please head to Gate 18.

279
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:11,750
See ya later, you poop-stained geezer!
I hope you live forever!

280
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,250
And you, his stubborn grandson!
Don't you dare forget me!

281
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,827
We'll meet again!

282
00:22:16,828 --> 00:22:20,750
Even if you're sick of my face, you bastard!

283
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,750
I couldn't forget a guy like you if I tried.

284
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,750
Take care.

285
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
See ya.

286
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,750
Yeah...

287
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,500
See ya.

288
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,250
Holly...

289
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,250
Why are you sitting up all of a sudden?

290
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:55,750
...I feel a lot better for some reason!

291
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,500
And I just felt something in my heart...

292
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,250
What?

293
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,250
They're both coming home, Mama!

294
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,500
Holly!

295
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,750
Papa and Jotaro!

296
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,250
They're coming home!
