1
00:00:10,683 --> 00:00:11,425
Hm?

2
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,225
<i>Dismantle</i>.

3
00:00:32,237 --> 00:00:33,801
That sword...

4
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:35,981
It specializes in combating cursed spirits,

5
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:37,283
the Sword of Extermination.

6
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:41,833
It's packed with the same positive energy
generated by a reverse cursed technique.

7
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:46,000
If I was a cursed spirit,

8
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:49,167
that would have eliminated
me on the first blow.

9
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:50,567
Hmph.

10
00:00:51,114 --> 00:00:52,300
Tastes bad.

11
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,000
You wanna go?

12
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,650
Oh?

13
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,017
You did something, didn't you?

14
00:03:22,683 --> 00:03:23,917
Now that felt odd.

15
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:48,933
Again?

16
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:44,917
Cursed energy?

17
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:49,050
You've done it now!

18
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,967
You can see it, huh?

19
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,950
My technique!

20
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:09,600
I knew it.

21
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:12,967
<i>Yamata no Orochi</i> is similar to you.

22
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:15,400
You follow my slices,

23
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,467
and attack with cursed energy...

24
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:21,683
Both started happening after
that great wheel revolved.

25
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:25,050
The incantation of sacred treasures

26
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:27,900
and that great wheel both represent
perfect cycles and harmony.

27
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,667
Which suggests that this <i>shikigami</i>'s ability

28
00:09:32,668 --> 00:09:35,150
is to adapt to <i>anything</i> and <i>everything</i>.

29
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,617
It's the ultimate late-throw
rock-paper-scissors!

30
00:09:40,183 --> 00:09:41,900
In the state I was in back then,

31
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:44,500
you might have defeated me.

32
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,417
Now you've fascinated me, Fushiguro Megumi!

33
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,217
<i>Domain Expansion:</i>

34
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,686
<i><b>Malevolent Shrine</b></i>.

35
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,342
Sukuna's Domain,

36
00:10:11,343 --> 00:10:12,871
<i>Malevolent Shrine</i>.

37
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,055
It's unlike others in that

38
00:10:16,057 --> 00:10:19,157
it does not cut out a
separate space with a barrier.

39
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,657
Manifesting an innate domain
without sealing it in a barrier

40
00:10:23,658 --> 00:10:28,057
is like using the air as a canvas
to paint a picture.

41
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,657
It's truly a divine feat.

42
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:36,714
To top it off, by adding a pact to
allow its victims a path of escape,

43
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:38,943
it vastly increases the range of
its sure-hit effect to

44
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:42,829

a maximum 200-meter radius.

45
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:47,543
Though out of consideration for 
its effect on Fushiguro Megumi,

46
00:10:47,544 --> 00:10:53,286
Sukuna has currently restrained the effect to 
a 140-meter radius limited to the surface.

47
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:07,914
Anything?

48
00:11:07,915 --> 00:11:09,457
Nope. No signal.

49
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,114
Me too.

50
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:13,957
Though, I don't think we
need to worry that much.

51
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:14,800
Huh?

52
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:17,357
Remember the guy with the 
megaphone?

53
00:11:20,586 --> 00:11:23,057
Sukuna's slices are comprised of two types.

54
00:11:23,543 --> 00:11:27,385
The slice that attacks things with cursed energy
in the range of his sure-hit effect is called

55
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,257
<i>"Cleave."</i>

56
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,357
the slice that attacks things
without cursed energy is called

57
00:11:30,358 --> 00:11:31,314
<i>"Dismantle."</i>

58
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:35,486
Until <i>Malevolent Shrine</i> disappears,
both will rain down endlessly.

59
00:11:37,457 --> 00:11:40,929
The only sure way to
defeat Mahoraga is to bury it,

60
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,786
with the first use of an
attack, before it can adapt.

61
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:48,471
<i>Cleave</i> would have
fulfilled those conditions,

62
00:11:48,472 --> 00:11:50,643
but that wouldn't necessarily hold true

63
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:54,143
if it had adapted to slices in general,

64
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,657
rather than to Dismantle.

65
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,271
Mahoraga was close to 
finishing its regeneration.

66
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,643
<i><b>Fuga<b></i>.
