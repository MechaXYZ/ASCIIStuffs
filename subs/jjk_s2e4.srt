1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,560
Let's go home, Riko-chan.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,100
Yeah!

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,580
Riko-chan?

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,080
Okay, job's done.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,410
You're free to go now.

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,330
Why are you here?

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,590
Why?

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,170
Oh, that's what you mean.

9
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,930
Because I killed Satoru Gojo.

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,390
Is that so?

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,430
Die!

12
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,960
Don't be so impatient.

13
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,110
The Tombs of the Star 
and the Forbidden Vault

14
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,700
use barriers that conceal.

15
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,200
So they can't place guards at the entrances.

16
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,580
As long as you know where the doors are,

17
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,160
they're full of holes.

18
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,410
Sorcerers are busy during this time of year,

19
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,830
and Jujutsu High is brimming 
with Fly Heads right now.

20
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,300
It's pure chaos outside.

21
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,220
And since I have no cursed energy, 
I'm like the invisible man.

22
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,180
There was one problem, though.

23
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,180
If I wield a cursed tool,

24
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,270
the cursed energy from it will stop 
me from being an invisible man.

25
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,610
Now, there's more to this story.

26
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,950
See, I keep a cursed spirit 
capable of storing objects around.

27
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,620
So I usually put my cursed tools 
in it when I'm walking around.

28
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,700
You don't have to say it.

29
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,410
Yes, that means the cursed energy from

30
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,250
the cursed spirit should stop me 
from being an invisible man.

31
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,420
So I make the cursed spirit smaller,
until it can fit inside my body.

32
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,550
Then I keep it inside my stomach.

33
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,640
After all, the organs of the invisible 
man are invisible, too, right?

34
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,640
That's how I'm able to 
pass through any barrier

35
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,100
while still carrying 
all kinds of cursed tools.

36
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,940
That's also why I didn't use 
a cursed tool at first.

37
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,820
A surprise attack on the Six Eyes

38
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,410
would be pointless if I wasn't invisible.

39
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,000
I could've killed the Star Plasma Vessel first,

40
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,540
but the risk of the Six Eyes seeing me was too—

41
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,460
Enough.

42
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,250
You have a Heavenly Pact, right?

43
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,960
I know revealing information about

44
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,420
your ability increases its fundamental 
strength, just like for a sorcerer.

45
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,930
That's not what I want to know.

46
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,470
How did you know which doors 
led to the Tombs of the Star?

47
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,180
We didn't leave even 
the slightest residuals.

48
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,870
Humans leave plenty of 
traces aside from residuals.

49
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,320
Like scents, footprints, and so on.

50
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,780
My pact enhances all five of my senses, too.

51
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,860
There should have been 
another woman on the way here.

52
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,240
What happened to her?

53
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,240
Hm?

54
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,080
Oh, that maid?

55
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,620
She's probably dead.

56
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,950
I didn't care if she lived or died, though.

57
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,660
If she's lucky, she might still be alive.

58
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,580
Is that so?

59
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,460
You really should... die!

60
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,900
<i>That Rainbow Dragon has 
the toughest hide there is!</i>

61
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,100
Curse Manipulation...

62
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,230
Riffraff.

63
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,070
Hey, am...

64
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,830
Am... Am I...

65
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,410
pretty?

66
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,250
<i>A potential apparition?</i>

67
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,040
<i>It deploys a simple domain that</i>

68
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,760
<i>enforces non-violence on both of us 
until I answer its question, then?</i>

69
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,590
Ah, well...

70
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,420
Then I'll just come out and say

71
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,690
you're not my type.

72
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,180
So that's how it is.

73
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,150
Idiot.

74
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,360
It's over.

75
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,110
For you!

76
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,370
<i>Curse Manipulation.</i>

77
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,950
<i>It's a technique that lets me 
absorb cursed spirits</i>

78
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,370
<i>that have surrendered, 
and freely manipulate them.</i>

79
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,330
<i>If there's roughly a two-grade 
difference in our levels,</i>

80
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,750
<i>I skip making them submit</i>

81
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,920
<i>and absorb them unconditionally.</i>

82
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,780
<i>His cursed spirit may have a unique ability, 
but it's not that strong itself.</i>

83
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,930
<i>I can absorb it. That'll lock down his armory.</i>

84
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,800
<i>Then I can just brute-force him—</i>

85
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,460
I didn't cut you badly enough to kill you.

86
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,000
I would've killed you if 
you were a shikigami user,

87
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,380
but since it's Curse Manipulation,

88
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,810
there's no telling what might happen to the 
cursed spirits you've absorbed after you die.

89
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,780
I'd rather avoid extra trouble here.

90
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,020
You have the blessing of parentage.

91
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,770
But even with that blessing,

92
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,320
you were all beaten by a monkey like me 
who can't even use cursed techniques.

93
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,570
If you want to live a long life, 
never forget that.

94
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,040
Oh, speaking of blessings...

95
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,000
That's right. I almost forgot.

96
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,210
I named him Megumi.

98
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,620
Go on, now.

99
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,170
The corpse of the Star Plasma 
Vessel, Riko Amanai.

100
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,790
All four limbs intact, too.

101
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,840
Hmm, indeed.

102
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,970
We'll issue your payment as we discussed.

104
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,100
I'll even throw in a bonus.

105
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,270
Thank you, Founder.

106
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,600
You're so generous.

107
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,690
He's not the founder.

108
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,690
Huh?

109
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,310
Do you mean it?

110
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:46,070
I know it was a necessary expense, 
but you've already helped us out a lot, too.

111
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,740
I thought you'd complain a bit more.

112
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:54,030
We hired you for the assassination 
expecting that it would fail.

113
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,990
Our Star Religious Group 
was founded in the Nara Era,

114
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,210
when Tengen-sama began preaching

115
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,580
about the moral foundation 
of jujutsu sorcerers,

116
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,160
a minority, as Buddhism 
spread throughout Japan.

117
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,300
Jujutsu society and religious corporations 
are at complete odds with each other.

118
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,550
That strain is what gave birth

119
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,890
to our modern Star Religious Group, 
the Time Vessel Association.

120
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,310
That is also why we have devoted 
ourselves to remaining non-sorcerers.

121
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,150
Jujutsu sorcerers are granted 
many privileges above the law,

122
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,070
but they're still fundamentally forbidden 
to lay a hand on non-sorcerers.

123
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,110
However, the time had finally arrived.

124
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,360
The time of the taboo 
recorded in our scriptures!

125
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,450
Our Star Religious Group has evolved to

126
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,660
a monotheistic religion 
worshiping one absolute god!

127
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,710
And it was now time for our object of 
worship to assimilate with that impurity!

128
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,590
If our believers saw us simply sit back 
and watch the assimilation happen,

129
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,340
our Association would crumble.

130
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:52,590
Yet if we took excessive action, 
jujutsu sorcerers would crush us.

131
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,350
So we were truly desperate.

132
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,560
And how did it all turn out?

133
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,980
We thought we were going to lose everything,

134
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,100
and now we have it all!

135
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,570
Of course that would 
loosen our purse strings.

136
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:14,110
Human society might be what crumbles 
if Tengen-sama loses control, though.

137
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,700
If we should perish along with our star, 
then that is all there is to it.

138
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,760
Were you referring to Okinawa 
when you said they helped us?

139
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,630
Yeah.

140
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,180
Why didn't you kill the maid then?

141
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,590
I know I told you,

142
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,310
"Take her someplace far away, 
and kill her at some point."

143
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:49,070
Because I had a good idea of what 
you were planning at the time.

144
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,140
I made the call that the relief 
from the maid's successful rescue

145
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,990
would wear him down more than 
heightened tensions from failure.

146
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:01,940
You often ignore the lines of communication 
and toss out whatever I was planning, right?

147
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,580
It all worked out in the end.

148
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,830
And stop running your mediator ragged.

149
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,590
Yeah, but why Okinawa?

150
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,880
I had a laugh at that myself.

151
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,050
Normally, you'd use a car 
to transport a captive, right?

152
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,260
Public transportation carries 
too many risks, after all.

153
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,810
But get this. The president 
owned his own private jet.

154
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,690
Even so...

155
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,650
Rich people think on a different scale, man.

156
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,990
Well, let's go eat with their money.

157
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,620
Take me to one of the 
restaurants you use for clients.

158
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,620
No way.

159
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,620
You never pay for a guy, anyway.

160
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,410
I've already decided I'll only see you

161
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,630
either for work or in Hell.

162
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,850
Huh?

163
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,650
Hey, it's been a while.

164
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,150
For real?

165
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,110
For real, real.

166
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,370
I'm alive and kicking!

167
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,560
Reverse cursed technique!

168
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,830
Bingo!

169
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,430
When you stabbed me through the throat,

170
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,960
I gave up on counterattacking

171
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,790
and poured all my focus into 
the reverse cursed technique.

172
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,460
Cursed energy is negative energy.

173
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,680
While it can enhance the body, 
it can't regenerate it.

174
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,260
So you multiply that negative energy 
against itself to create positive energy.

175
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,020
That's the reverse cursed technique.

176
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,850
Easier said than done!

177
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,220
I hadn't been able to do 
that up until now myself!

178
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,810
And I couldn't understand anything 
the one person who could do it said!

179
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,810
<i>He's blabbing on and on...</i>

180
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,530
<i>He's high.</i>

181
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,480
But I finally grasped it 
on the verge of death!

182
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,480
The true essence of cursed energy!

183
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,080
The reason you're going to lose is 
because you didn't chop my head off,

184
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,750
and because you didn't use that cursed 
tool when you stabbed my head.

185
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,750
I'm going to lose?

186
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,540
Our fight is just getting started.

187
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,960
Oh? Is that right?

188
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,470
Maybe you're right.

189
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,260
<b>YOU'RE SO RIGHT!</b>

190
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,150
<i>Cursed Technique Reversal:</i>

191
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,150
<i>Red.</i>

192
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,910
Monster.

193
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,760
<i>No bones are broken.</i>

194
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,680
<i>That shock wave was an 
application of Limitless,</i>

195
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,720
<i>the cursed technique reversal, Red, huh?</i>

196
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,190
<i>So he poured the positive energy generated 
by the reverse cursed technique</i>

197
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:19,990
<i>into the Limitless 
technique ingrained into him.</i>

198
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,570
<i>One, the power to stop:</i>

199
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,740
<i>the neutral application 
of the Limitless technique.</i>

200
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,410
<i>Two, the power to attract:</i>

201
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,120
<i>the amplified application of 
the Limitless technique, Blue.</i>

202
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,580
<i>And three, the power to repel:</i>

203
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,420
<i>the reversal of his cursed technique, Red.</i>

204
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,330
<i>All things I can handle.</i>

205
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,300
<i>Something's off.</i>

206
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,430
<i>Something's off.</i>

207
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,440
No, this is fine.

208
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,980
I'll kill you.

209
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,470
<i>Sorry, Amanai.</i>

210
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,470
<i>I'm not even angry over you right now.</i>

211
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,680
<i>I bear no grudge against anyone.</i>

212
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:37,700
<i>It's just that the world feels 
so, so wonderful right now.</i>

213
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,960
"Throughout Heaven and Earth, 
I alone am the honored one."

214
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,670
<i>The merit of having a technique 
that's passed down for generations</i>

215
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,260
<i>is having a user's manual.</i>

216
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,720
<i>The demerit is that</i>

217
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,640
<i>information about the
technique is easily leaked.</i>

218
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,600
<i>You were a member of 
the Zen'in clan, weren't you?</i>

219
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,480
<i>That's why you know so much 
about the Limitless technique.</i>

220
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,320
<i>However, even in the Gojo clan,</i>

221
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,610
<i>only a scant few know about this.</i>

222
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,710
<i>Take the amplified and the reversal,</i>

223
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,540
<i>then smash together those 
two different expressions</i>

224
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,210
<i>of infinity to create and 
push out imaginary mass.</i>

225
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,970
<i>Imaginary Technique: Purple.</i>

226
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,560
<i>Something's off.</i>

227
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,480
<i>"I refuse to do any work for free."</i>

228
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:05,110
<i>Normally I would've said that 
and hightailed it out of there.</i>

229
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,820
<i>Yet the freshly awakened wielder of the 
Limitless technique was right before my eyes.</i>

230
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,450
<i>He was probably the strongest jujutsu 
sorcerer of the modern age.</i>

231
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
<i>I wanted to reject him.</i>

232
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,290
<i>I wanted to bring him to his knees.</i>

233
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,040
<i>I wanted to take down the 
pinnacle of the jujutsu world</i>

234
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,670
<i>and the Zen'in clan that rejected me.</i>

235
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:30,630
<i>I twisted myself to try to affirm myself.</i>

236
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,680
<i>That was the moment I lost.</i>

237
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,690
<i>I thought you had abandoned that pride.</i>

238
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:54,280
<i>I thought you had chosen to live without 
respecting yourself or anyone else.</i>

239
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,200
Any last words?

240
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,670
Nah.

241
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,270
Two or three years from now,

242
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,940
my kid will be sold off to the Zen'in clan.

243
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,600
Do what you will with that.

244
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,270
Mommy!

245
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Hug me!

246
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,430
You're late, Suguru.

247
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,100
No, I guess you got here fast.

248
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,390
There are several Star Religious 
Group facilities in the city, after all.

249
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,360
Satoru? Is that you?

250
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,820
What happened?

251
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,490
I see you already saw Shoko.

252
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,910
Yeah, she healed me.

253
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,870
I'm fine now.

254
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,380
No, me being safe doesn't 
help anything here.

255
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,300
I screwed up.

256
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,750
You're not at fault.

257
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,880
Let's head back.

258
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,010
Suguru, should we kill these guys?

259
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,720
The way I feel right now, 
I doubt I'd feel anything about it.

260
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,690
No. There's no point.

261
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,060
It looks like there are only 
common believers here.

262
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,950
The masterminds who know about our 
world have probably fled already.

263
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,780
And unlike with the bounty,

264
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,490
they won't be able to 
talk their way out of this.

265
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,910
The organization had 
problems to begin with.

266
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,880
It'll be dissolved soon enough.

267
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,170
No point, huh?

268
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,670
Does there really need 
to be any point to it?

269
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,180
It's very important that there is.

270
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,810
Especially for a jujutsu sorcerer.

271
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,800
I wonder if whoever came up with the phrase

272
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,070
"a surprising side" 
thought of people as cubes,

273
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,400
and if whoever came up with the insult

274
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,830
"shallow" thought of people as flat surfaces?

275
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,540
Next time, "Premature Death."

276
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,580
Either way, people do have two sides to them.
